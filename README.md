# Grading Helper

This is the grading helper program I made to help with processing student submissions!
It's mostly for personal use, but I'm storing it here in case anybody else wants to use
it or build upon it.

### It does 3 main things:
⚪ Unzips all submissions
⚪ Stores each submission in its own folder
⚪ Creates a .txt file for grading purposes for each submission.

### Some minor things:
⚫ Depending on the class you're grading for, you can change how the .txt file is generated.
⚫ 
⚫ All the zip files are stored in a zip folder.

### For the future:
Check the Issues section. :)

I may create a release version if there is interest for internal use.
