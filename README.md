# Grading Helper

This is the grading helper program I made to help with processing student submissions!
It's mostly for personal use, but I'm storing it here in case anybody else wants to use
it or build upon it.

When downloading bulk student submissions, they are stored in one giant compressed file.
Each student submission is typically one folder deep and stored as a .zip.

This program loops through and unzips everything for you and generates a grading file for you to fill in as you grade.

### It does 3 main things:
⚪ Unzips all submissions, even if the zips are "stacked".

⚪ Stores each submission in its own folder

⚪ Creates a .txt file for grading purposes with each submission listed and some general grading information.

### Some minor things:
⚫ Depending on the class you're grading for, you can change how the .txt file is generated.

⚫ All the zip files are stored in a zip folder.

⚫ This program solves the problem of repeated copy-pasting and unzipping submissions by hand, saving time.

### For the future:
Check the Issues section. :)

I may create a release version if there is interest for internal use.
